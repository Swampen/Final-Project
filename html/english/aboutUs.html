          <h2>About us</h2>
          <p>
            We are a group of four students, currently in our first semester of the bachelor degree in Software Engineering, at Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences. We have this current semester worked with different assignments related to web-design and relevant challenges. None of the group members had any experience with HTML or CSS before we attended this course. We have through different assignments acquired knowledge regarding the design and construction of websites. This knowledge was used in the development of the website you are currently visiting.

          <h2>About the Website</h2>
          <p>
            The website you are currently on is the result of the final assignment in the web project course. The assignment was to identify a technological- or social oriented problem and a solution to said problem. Further, this was to be presented as a website. Universal design was an important subject during this course as well as in the development of this website. By designing with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted/tips/designing.html" target="_blank">W3C design tips</a> in mind, we hope that everyone will be able to enjoy our product, regardless of disabilities or challenges.
          </p>
          When addressing the assignment, we started with a brainstorming session to identify possible problems to work with. After choosing a relevant problem, possible solutions were discussed. The group settled on the JobString concept. One reason for choosing this particular challenge of keeping track of job applications and advertisements is that we can relate to this problem. As students ourselves, we apply for several jobs, especially near the end of our studies. Thus, this solution will be very useful to us and highly desirable. We also believe it will be useful for others actively looking for a job, applying for many positions.

            The sources used in the development of JobString, and this website, is solely used for guidance and development of the website as a whole. They are as follows:
