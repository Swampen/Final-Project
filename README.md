# Final-Project

This is a final group project for the DAFE1200 Webprosjekt class at Oslo Metropolitan University.

### Description
The task was to find a problem in the modern society today, find a possible solution and make a website describing it. So we ended up tackling the problem with applying for jobs on many different job sites. Since we usually will lose track of where we applied, at what point in time, and when the application due was. We came up with the idea about a website that would connect all application sites, and have an organized system so the user would easily find enjoying to use.
The website we had to make had to consist only of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (optional) without any use of frameworks.
The website we ended up making is hosted here: https://swampen.github.io/JobString/html/index.html
